			<p>Harry Trueman was grateful that the Child had come to him in this last hour of pain.</p>
			<p>“I told you once⁠—far away from here⁠—that the day would come when the World and the Church would lie at your feet, and that then you would know Darkness and Light!”</p>
			<p>“And you told me,” breathed the young soldier, “to fling down the weapons of Darkness and take up the weapons of Light!”</p>
			<p>“Yes⁠—you did not understand then⁠—but now you know!”</p>
			<p>“Yes, now I know!” he answered more firmly.</p>
			<p>“And tonight,” said the Child, “the Message will go forth to all the world: “How long halt ye between two thoughts? If the LORD be God, follow Him; but if Baal, then follow him!”</p>
			<p>“I have already chosen, beautiful Child!” Yet the soldier’s brow was damp with the sweat of agony. “Can you not understand that in all good faith I took up my sword to die for Him, yet in His hour of need I denied Him?”</p>
			<p>“He knows even that!” said the Child softly, “and you shall not, even yet, lack suffering for His sake.”</p>
			<p>The Child was gone. The man turned off the lights, and went out for half an hour into the darkened streets.</p>
